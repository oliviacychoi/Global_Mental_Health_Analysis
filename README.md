# Global Mental Health Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This repository contains a project focused on analyzing global mental health metrics, specifically regarding prevalence rates across different demographics (such as age, gender, and country) from 2002 - 2021. The project integrates multiple datasets (1.6M+ records), processes them using SQL, and visualizes the findings using Tableau to provide insights into global mental health trends.

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate how SQL and Tableau can be leveraged together to clean, transform, analyze, and visualize complex datasets for actionable insights in public health.  

The analysis revealed a significant increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression disorders, with a notable spike during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting the urgent need for targeted mental health interventions and policies worldwide.
